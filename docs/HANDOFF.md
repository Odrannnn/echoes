# Handoff

Orientation for whoever picks this up next, human or agent. Read this first, then
`docs/RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` for how the work is run and `PORT_NOTES.md` for how the port
itself works. This file is the map and the current position; those two are the detail.

## The state, measured

```
matched    3020 / 28465 functions        (7.95% fuzzy, 7.08% of code, 4.85% fully linked)
DOL units  2659 / 16726 functions        (main/* units, including the SDK's 882)
REL units   361 / 11739 functions        (the 86 modules)
```

Verify all of that yourself; do not trust this file's numbers over the report:

```sh
./tools/decomp_build.sh            # ninja + objdiff + the All: line
python3 - <<'PY'
import re, hashlib, os
cfg = open('config/G2ME01/config.yml').read()
ok = 0
for name, exp in re.findall(r'object: files/RelProd/(\S+)\n\s+hash: ([0-9a-f]{40})', cfg):
    mod = name[:-4]; p = f'build/G2ME01/{mod}/{mod}.rel'
    a = hashlib.sha1(open(p,'rb').read()).hexdigest() if os.path.exists(p) else 'missing'
    ok += a == exp
print(f'{ok}/86 modules match config.yml')
PY
```

Last known good: the commit that last touched this file (`git log -1 --format=%h -- docs/HANDOFF.md`).
As of the numbers above: DOL sha1 `6ef9b491d0cc08bc81a124fdedb8bfaec34d0010`, all 86 RELs
byte-identical to `orig/G2ME01/files/RelProd/`, probe 114 files 0 failures, symbol check 0 missing.
(The old form of this line pinned a commit hash, which cannot be written down in the commit that
creates it.)

## What this repository is

Two things at once, and it is easy to confuse them:

- **A port** of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to PC, built on Aurora (the MIT GameCube SDK/GX
  replacement). The port layer is essentially complete: REL runtime, entry point, SDK shims,
  disc tools, tests. It cannot run because the decompilation is 6.75% done.
- **A contribution to the decompilation** (`PrimeDecomp/echoes`), which is what the remaining
  work actually is. Every rule about completion in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` comes from this half.
  The public upstream tree is reachable and **ahead of us in units we have not written** (and behind
  in others); from 2026-09-25 the rule is to port from it only where the gates pass, attributed in
  the commit. See "Upstream, and what we take from it" in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` for the measured
  cost of doing that and the units it has been done for.

## Tools, in the order you will want them

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `./tools/decomp_build.sh [unit]` | ninja, then objdiff, then that unit's unmatched functions |
| `tools/flip_test.sh <unit>` | **the acceptance test** - flip to `Matching`, rebuild, keep only if the DOL and all 86 RELs still reproduce retail |
| `tools/compare_unit.sh <unit>` | diagnostic: how our object differs from the retail-derived one |
| `tools/check_symbol_names.py` | every name `symbols.txt` declares vs what the retail object defines |
| `tools/find_trivial_functions.py` | unmatched functions classified by machine-code shape - the cheap-work queue |
| `tools/scaffold_rel_module.py` | the three artifacts for starting a REL module |
| `tools/probe_sources.sh` | the port build's syntax sweep (114 files) |
| `build/binutils/powerpc-eabi-objdump`, `powerpc-eabi-nm` | disassemble / list symbols |

There is **no system cmake or ninja**. Use
`/run/media/odran/Leo/projects/Restored-projects/Chatgpt/MetroidPrimePort/build/review-tools/bin/`
for cmake/ctest/ninja, and that port's `build/compilers` and `build/tools/{dtk,wibo}` for the
matching build.

## The one rule that decides whether work counts

A unit is done when the build still reproduces retail **with that unit's own object in the
link**. `configure.py` decides this: `NonMatching` links bytes `dtk` split out of the retail
binary, `Matching` links our compile. So objdiff percentages on a `NonMatching` unit are a
signal, not a result, and `87 files OK` proves nothing about a unit that is not `Matching` -
it validates the untouched parts of the binary. Two sessions were spent on this; see
"the one rule" in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md`.

## Two independent workstreams, and where each stands

**1. The DOL** - 2659 of 16726 functions, ~14k left (that figure includes the SDK's 882, which are
essentially complete). Verified matches land here steadily, and the two units the whole port was
waiting on are in: `CAi` 11/11 and `CPatterned` 10/10, both `Matching`. Others:
`TypesMatch` 508/511, `CStateManager` 64/239, `CPlayerGun` 62/135, `CPlayerState` 69/72.
The reachable pools are thinning; what remains is dominated by FPU register allocation,
instruction scheduling, string-pool offsets, and weak rstl instantiations whose callers are
not decompiled. All of those are documented in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` - check it before
spending a session rediscovering one.

**`TypesMatch` was gated on naming, and that is now measured and paid off** (2026-09-25).
508 of 511 functions are exact: the first 94 (`30` `TypesMatch` overrides plus `64` `TCastToPtr`
casts) were landed under the placeholder class names `CUnknown<id>`, because every naming source
in the tree - the previous versions' configs, `symbols.txt`, the DOL's strings, the RELs - was
exhausted and none of them names those 32 classes. The *shape* is not a guess: each class's parent
is the class whose `::TypesMatch` the retail override calls, and the addresses come from the vtable
holding each id. `docs/research/TypesMatch_unnamed_ids.txt` is that table;
`docs/research/rename_typesmatch_ids.py` regenerates the block from it, so identifying a class later
is one line and a re-run, and it is now known what three of those classes are: id 76 has no members,
id 63 is `optional_object<TCachedToken<T>>` at 0x158, id 50 is an empty `CScriptDamageableTrigger`
subclass. **Three functions remain**, all characterised: `fn_8009D3D8` (93.27%) and `fn_8009D45C`
(79.70%) need a stack home and an outgoing-arg copy retail has and no source shape produced, and
`fn_80097520` is a 32-byte MWCC thunk to an unnamed function that nothing references.

**2. The REL modules** - 331 of 11739 functions, 86 modules. That count is low partly because
claiming a range for a unit *removes* those bytes from the `auto_*` units that match for free -
see "why the matched total can go down" in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md`. **The recipe works and is written
up**: a module may be partly decompiled, with the `Matching` unit claiming only the ranges its
own object reproduces and everything else unclaimed so `dtk` fills it from retail.

**Measure this, never recall it**: `python3 tools/check_module_wiring.py`. As of 2026-09-25 it reports
**23 units of our own code in 15 modules** - `FlyerSwarm`, `Metaree`, `RubiksPuzzle`,
`ScriptFrontEndDataNetwork`, `ScriptGui`, `ScriptPlayerActor`, `ScriptPlayerProxy`,
`ScriptPlayerTurret`, `ScriptRiftPortal`, `ScriptRsfAudio`, `ScriptSafeZone`, `ScriptStreamedMovie`,
`SwarmBasics`, `Tweaks`, `WallCrawler`. The list this paragraph used to carry was wrong in both
directions and is exactly the kind of claim that must not be written from memory:

- `Puffer`, `WallCrawler` and `ScriptGui` had **lost their `Rel(...)` blocks** to later commits that
  copied an older `configure.py` (`33b73a3` replaced Puffer's block with WallCrawler's own; `f599488`
  dropped WallCrawler's and ScriptGui's). Their sources had been sitting in `src/` compiled by
  nothing, which is why the report showed those units at 0.00%. Restoring the blocks and the
  `Matching` states they had is worth **30 matched functions**, and `check_module_wiring.py` exists so
  the next one is caught the same day.
- `AIMannedTurret` was called "the working example" - it is not. Its unit is at 3/3 in the report, but
  promoting it to `Matching` **breaks the module's hash** (85/86), so its code is not in the link and
  never was. It stays `NonMatching`.
- `Puffer`'s units were `NonMatching` even in the commit that landed them, so its earlier "sha1
  verified" claim proved nothing - the vacuous-verification trap the rules warn about.

**The creature base classes now exist** (`CAi`, `CPatterned`), so the 75 creature and swarm modules
are no longer blocked on the hierarchy existing - only on their own code, and on `CPatterned`'s
0xB58-byte constructor if they need it.

## The blocker: CPatterned, and the base classes below it

**`CAi` is done** (2026-09-25): 11 of 11 functions, `Matching`, DOL sha1 and all 86 RELs still
reproducing retail. The "cyclic link-order dependency" that this section used to describe **was
never real** - the split is accepted, and what blocked it was ordinary symbol renaming. What looked
like a cycle was CodeWarrior COMDAT weak symbols that both linkers discard. The full account, the
rename list and the two traps (claim *all* four sections; a `.sdata2` split may not end inside a dtk
`lbl_`) are in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md`, section "CAi: landed, and the cyclic link-order dependency
was never real". Read that before touching anything in `include/MetroidPrime/Enemies/`.

**`CPatterned` is landed as well** (2026-09-25): a `Matching` unit with 10 of 10 functions at 100%,
claimed as the 92 bytes of the small accessor cluster at `0x80073C58..0x80073CB4` rather than the
0xB58-byte constructor. The class exists, its vtable relocations resolve, and the creature modules
are no longer blocked on the hierarchy existing - only on their own code.

**What is left of the hierarchy:** `CPatterned`'s constructor at `0x80079BE4` (0xB58 bytes, 82-slot
vtable at `0x803B2458`, size 0x7c0) is untouched and is the next big single item; five of its sibling
accessors are unclaimed; its 36 own virtuals are unnamed. `fn_80079BE4` is still named `fn_` in
`symbols.txt`, deliberately - renaming it is the first step of writing it.

The other hierarchy gaps, unchanged: `include/MetroidPrime/Enemies/` holds the `SwarmBasics` layer
and now `CAi`/`CPatterned` headers; there is still no `CPatterned.cpp`, no GUI hierarchy
(`src/GuiSys/` and `include/GuiSys/` are empty and unlisted), and `UnkVtable20` is resolved.

## Running lanes

The work is done by many agents in parallel, one per module or unit, each in its own git
worktree with its own real `build/` directory (not a symlink - see the rig defect in
`RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md`). The full spawn sequence, the non-negotiable details, how to collect a
lane, and the failures that recur are all in that file's "Parallel lanes" section. The two
things that cost the most time:

- **A lane's `config/` is its own view, never a patch.** Copying a lane's `symbols.txt` or
  `splits.txt` can silently revert a later rename, or delete an existing split block. Merge by
  hand against current `HEAD` and diff. This cost a lost `UnkVtable20` rename and two lost
  `configure.py` entries.
- **Verify a lane's report independently.** They have been wrong in both directions - one
  understated its own result by ten functions, several cited verification that proved nothing
  because their unit was `NonMatching`, and one reported its completed work as missing.

## Keeping this documentation true

These three files are load-bearing: a session that trusts a stale handoff wastes its whole
budget re-deriving what the last one knew. So updating them is **part of finishing a piece of
work**, not a separate chore. The rule is short:

**If you changed the answer to a question one of these files answers, update that file in the
same commit as the change.**

Concretely, after any turn that changes the position or the method:

| what changed | where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| matched counts, which units/modules are done | the state block at the top of this file |
| a unit or module is now `Matching` and verified | the state block, and the module table in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` |
| a new blocker found, or an old one cleared | the blocker section here, and the relevant one in `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` |
| a technique that worked, or a pattern that cannot work | `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` (recipe, known-hard, gates) |
| a module attempted, whatever the outcome | the "Attempted modules" table at the end of `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` |
| how the port itself works | `PORT_NOTES.md` |
| a lane-collection or lane-spawning lesson | the "Parallel lanes" section of `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` |

Rules for the writing itself, learned by getting it wrong:

- **Measure numbers, do not recall them.** Every wrong figure found in these files was written
  from memory. Run `./tools/decomp_build.sh` and the config.yml hash check and quote what they
  print. If a number in a doc disagrees with `build/report.json`, the report wins.
- **Annotate stale checkpoints, do not silently rewrite history.** If a figure was right at the
  time it was written, leave it and mark it as a checkpoint pointing at the current source of
  truth. `PORT_NOTES.md` line ~340 does this.
- **Say what is not known.** "CPatterned's constructor was not attempted" is worth more than a
  confident-sounding guess, and it is what stops the next session repeating the work.
- **A negative result belongs in the docs.** The CAi link-order cycle, the assembly dead end,
  the vacuous `NonMatching` verification - each cost a session, and each is now one paragraph
  that saves the next one.
- **Do not let a doc outlive its claim.** If a statement is superseded, correct it in place and
  note that it was superseded; an earlier version of `RUNNING_THE_DECOMP.md` concluded that no
  module could be decompiled, which was wrong two sessions later.

There is a repo `AGENTS.md` that repeats the short version of this, so an agent that never
opens this file still sees it.
