/**
 * The pool's stand-in answers, and the retail string pool they are named after.
 *
 * **Not a `configure.py` unit**, for the reason every file in this group gives (see
 * `src/MetroidPrime/PortGlobals.cpp`'s header for the measurement: one added `static` in
 * `MetroidPrime/main.cpp` moved `__ct__CGameArchitectureSupport` 84.51% -> 81.54%). Nothing
 * here can reach `main.dol` or any of the 86 REL modules. It is listed in `files.cmake`, so the
 * port build compiles it, and mwcceppc never sees it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists: the boot stopped on a *name*, not on a missing symbol
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `tools/boot_probe.sh` ran 103 reach-stubs deep and died here, with no undefined symbol left to
 * blame:
 *
 *   CSimplePool::GetObj(const SObjectTag&, CVParamTransfer)
 *   CSimplePool::GetObj(const char*, CVParamTransfer)
 *   CSimplePool::GetObj(const char*)
 *   CGameGlobalObjects::LoadStringTable()
 *   CMain::RsMain(int, char const* const*)
 *
 * The two statements in front of it are retail's, in order
 * (`src/MetroidPrime/main.cpp:244`):
 *
 *   stringTable = gpSimplePool->GetObj(lbl_803A56C0 + 0x146);   // 0x146 = "STRG_Main"
 *   gpStringTable = **stringTable;
 *
 * and `GetObj(const char*)` is three lines of forwarding
 * (`src/Kyoto/CSimplePoolPort.cpp`):
 *
 *   GetObj(const char* name)            -> GetObj(name, x1c_paramXfr)
 *   GetObj(const char* name, CVParamTransfer xfer)
 *                                       -> GetObj(*GetFactory().GetResourceIdByName(name), xfer)
 *
 * so the fault is `*` on a null `const SObjectTag*`: **`CResFactory::GetResourceIdByName`
 * returns null because no pak is loaded**, and retail's own code does not test the result
 * either. `AddPaksAndFactories` - the 1,936 bytes of boot-path step 13 that would fill the
 * loader - runs to completion one statement earlier, which is why the pool machinery itself
 * works and only the *name* is missing.
 *
 * **This is a data wall, and the data is a pak.** Retail resolves a name through
 * `CResFactory::GetResourceIdByName` (0x80006B80) -> `CResLoader::GetResIdByName`
 * (0x802FCC44, `Matching` in `src/Kyoto/CResLoaderGetResIdByName.cpp`) ->
 * `CPakFile::GetResIdByName` (0x803236CC, `src/Kyoto/CPakFile.cpp`). All three are written. The
 * thing that is missing is the `CPakFile` they walk, and a `CPakFile` comes out of
 * `Strings.pak` on the disc. Stubbing the *symbols* cannot supply that, which is the negative
 * result the probe's own log records: every added stub moves the fault, none of them populates
 * a pool.
 *
 * So this file does what `src/MetroidPrime/PortTweakGlobals.cpp` did for `gpTweakPlayerA`:
 * **it puts a real object at a real address for a name the game asks for by name, and it says in
 * the source that the object is a stand-in.** No frame is faked; the boot is moved past a name
 * lookup, and whatever the next name is, the next backtrace will name it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Second user, 2026-09-27: `CCubeRenderer`'s eight pool names
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The same mechanism, and the same reason. `CCubeRenderer`'s constructor (`fn_80271238`, retail
 * 0x80271238) asks the store for eight names by string literal, so it reaches this registry the
 * same way `LoadStringTable` does - through `CSimplePool::GetObj(const char*)`, which asks here
 * before it asks the factory. **The entries and the reasoning are all further down, under
 * `kEntries`; this paragraph is here so a reader arriving at the top of the file knows the second
 * user exists.** The measurement, the three faults and the marker that replaced them are in
 * `docs/HANDOFF.md`, "The pool answers all eight of `CCubeRenderer`'s token names".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it bought, measured
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `tools/boot_probe.sh`, same machine, same disc, same hardware Vulkan ICD:
 *
 *   before  103 reach-stubs, `[port] caught SIGSEGV` with the backtrace above.
 *   after   114 reach-stubs, **no SIGSEGV and no backtrace at all.** The ladder in
 *           `src/MetroidPrime/PortBoot.cpp` now runs to the end of what it has:
 *
 *             Initializing renderer...                <- PostInitialize's own printf, real text
 *             boot: step 12 returned
 *             boot: step 12 - gpRender is non-null for the first time
 *             boot: step 17 - new CGameArchitectureSupport(*osContext)
 *             boot: step 17 returned - the constructor completed
 *             boot: step 18/18 returned, 19/19 returned, 20/20 returned
 *
 *           The eleven stubs that are new are 0104-0108 (`CCallStack`, from the renderer's
 *           allocation) and 0109-0114: `CEnvFxManager::Initialize`, `fn_8033CEE8`,
 *           `CMain::ResetGameState`, `CConsoleOutputWindow::CConsoleOutputWindow`,
 *           `CAudioStateWin::CAudioStateWin`, `mp_cswarmbasics_exit`. **Three of those are on
 *           the project's named port-blocking list** - `ResetGameState` and
 *           `CConsoleOutputWindow` are two of them - so this made them *reached*, which they
 *           were not before.
 *
 *   **No frame was rendered and none is claimed.** `gpRender` being non-null is not a renderer:
 *           `AllocateRenderer` (0x8026EF54) returns a pointer to an object whose constructor
 *           `fn_80271238` (0x80271238, 0x59C = 1436 bytes) is still a stub - the run log shows
 *           `[auto-stub] fn_80271238` and `[auto-stub] fn_80272958` - and the ladder's
 *           `CMain::RsMain` has no loop in it. The next wall is those two functions, then the
 *           frame loop. `src/MetroidPrime/PortBoot.cpp:240` already says the same about
 *           `fn_80271238`, and this is now the measured state rather than the predicted one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `lbl_803A56C0` - retail's own 0x1C0 bytes, transcribed
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `.rodata:0x803A56C0`, `size:0x1C0` in `config/G2ME01/symbols.txt`, and **it is not a stand-in**:
 * every byte below is retail's, read out of `build/G2ME01/main.elf` with
 * `powerpc-eabi-objdump -s -j .rodata --start-address=0x803A56C0 --stop-address=0x803A5880`. It is
 * here rather than in `src/MetroidPrime/PortGlobals.cpp` because the *reason* it has to exist is
 * the name table immediately below: `LoadStringTable` asks for `lbl_803A56C0 + 0x146`, and
 * without the object at that address the pointer is 0x146 bytes past nothing.
 *
 * Until now the symbol was undefined in the port and `tools/boot_probe.sh`'s self-heal stubbed
 * it **as a function** (`extern "C" void lbl_803A56C0(void)`), which linked and made every
 * `lbl_803A56C0 + N` read N bytes past a zero-filled function body. That is why this definition
 * is a data object, and why the stale auto-stub was deleted from
 * `src/MetroidPrime/PortReachStubs.cpp` by hand - which is the fix `tools/boot_probe.sh`'s own
 * duplicate-definition branch prescribes ("delete the stale alias from PortReachStubs.cpp, not
 * the real definition").
 *

 * not have to re-derive them:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **This is the registry's own key space and it is not retail's.** A resource's real
// `CAssetId` is a row in whichever pak's resource table the object came out of, and no pak is
// on this machine (`docs/HANDOFF.md`, "PROVEN, and it is the answer to 'what would unblock a
// frame'"), so there is no real value to put here. Two things follow, and both are load-bearing:
//
// 1. **`kInvalidAssetId` for every entry would be a bug, not caution.** The pool's map is
//    `hash_map< SObjectTag, CObjectReference* >` keyed on `(type, id)`
//    (`include/Kyoto/CSimplePool.hpp`), and `CSimplePoolPort.cpp`'s `TagsEqual` compares both.
//    Four `CMDL_*` names sharing one id would be **one** map entry, so
//    `GetObj("CMDL_FlatCylinder")` would hand back the object already standing in for
//    `CMDL_FlatSphere` - two different names, one object, silently.
// 2. **These ids must not be mistaken for real ones later.** They start at `0xF0000000`,
//    where a pak's sequential ids never go, so a future entry carrying a *real* id cannot
//    collide with one of these by accident. If a real `Strings.pak` ever lands, every entry
//    below is replaced and this paragraph goes with it.

// `STRG` is the one of `AddPaksAndFactories`' 36 registrations the DOL's symbol table names,

// `fn_80271238`'s own `GetObj` arguments resolve to out of `.rodata` (see the "eight pool names"
// section of `src/MetaRender/Carve80271238.cpp`, which is where the addresses were read). The

    // registrations the DOL's symbol table names, and `main.cpp:514` registers
    // `FStringTableFactory` under it, so this is the tag retail's own factory table answers with.
    //
    // **The object is a STAND-IN: a zeroed `CStringTable`, not the table out of the pak.** What
    // is missing is the English text `Strings.pak` holds; what a PC build has is the header. A
    // zeroed `CStringTable` is observably an *empty* table and provably a safe one:
    // `GetStringCount()` is 0, `GetStringIndex()` returns -1 without touching `xc_names` (its
    // `x4_nameCount` is 0), and both `GetString` overloads therefore return `skInvalidString`
    // (`src/Kyoto/Text/CStringTable.cpp:102`). Every string in the game will read "Invalid",
    // which is what the class itself answers when an index is out of range - so the failure mode
    // is a visible, correct-for-the-class answer rather than a crash.
    //
    // It is a raw zeroed block and not `new CStringTable(...)` for the reason
    // `PortTweakGlobals.cpp` gives: the class's only constructor is `CStringTable(CInputStream&)`,
    // so constructing one means handing `Load()` a stream, and `Load()` reads `languages[0]`
    // **before** it has checked that `langCount` is non-zero (`CStringTable.cpp:59`) - an empty
    // language table would index an empty `rstl::reserved_vector`. There is no stream on a PC
    // that carries the pak's bytes, so there is nothing honest to feed it.
    //
    // What would make this real, in order: `CResLoader::AddPakFileAsync` reaching a real
    // `Strings.pak` on the disc (boot-path step 13, `CGameGlobalObjects::AddPaksAndFactories`,
    // 1,936 bytes of retail with an empty body in this tree), and then `FStringTableFactory`

    // precision on a 64-bit host), so the port build's `FStringTableFactory` is the
    // `return rs_new ...`-free body in `src/Kyoto/CFactoryFunctionsPort.cpp:42`. Listing
    // `CStringTable.cpp` is a prerequisite, and the `uint` casts are the blocker.

    //
    // `CMain::FillInAssetIDs` (retail 0x80006B38, `src/MetroidPrime/main.cpp:581`) asks for it
    // by name and hands the tag straight to `gpSimplePool->fn_8029c7e8`. Answering the *name*
    // is therefore worth doing - it turns "the pool has never heard of this" into "the pool
    // knows the tag and cannot build the object", and the second is a real answer.
    //
    // The object is not stood in for three measured reasons. (1) The class is not identified:
    // `AddPaksAndFactories` registers `ATBL` with `fn_8029AB80` (`main.cpp:536`), and
    // `config/G2ME01/symbols.txt` does not name it, so there is no type to allocate. (2) The
    // consumer is `fn_8029c7e8`, which `CSimplePoolPort.cpp`'s own header records is **not a
    // pool method** - at 0x8029C7E8 it takes the store as an argument and calls `GetObj(tag)`
    // through vtable slot 0xC, in the audio code - so it has no body in this tree and asking
    // for the object would fault one frame later rather than here. (3) `CMain::FillInAssetIDs`
    // **is not on the host boot ladder**: `CMain::RsMain` in `src/MetroidPrime/PortBoot.cpp` runs
    // steps 12, 17, 18, 19 and 20 and then stops with a message; it never calls step 16. So a
    // stand-in object here would be an allocation nothing ever reads.
    //
    // There is a second, separate gap on that call, in a file this lane does not own: it reads
    // the tag with `gpResourceFactory->GetResourceIdByName(...)` **directly**, not through the
    // pool, and `CResFactory::GetResourceIdByName` is a `return nullptr;` in
    // `src/Kyoto/CResFactoryPortVirtuals.cpp:86`. The one-line fix, when `FillInAssetIDs` is
    // wired up, is for that body to return `port::pool::FindStandInTag(name)` before falling
    // through to the loader's own two-list walk.

    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The eight names `CCubeRenderer`'s constructor asks for, retail 0x80271238
    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // `src/MetaRender/Carve80271238.cpp` reads them out of `.rodata` at
    // `0x803AE3BC + {93, 106, 126, 144, 160, 179, 197, 218}`; that file's header has the
    // measurement and the `tools/dol_read.py` `.rodata` offset fix it needed to read them.
    //
    // **These eight are the boot's next wall, and it is a null dereference, not a missing
    // symbol.** Seven of them are members - `x4fc_bigRing`, `x508_darkWorldCloud`,
    // `x514_scanSweepBar`, `x520_flatSphere`, `x52c_flatSphereLow`, `x538_flatCylinder`,
    // `x544_flatCylinderLow` - and the eighth is a stack `TLockedToken<CTexture>` handed to
    // `fn_802711A4`, which builds a `CGraphicsPalette` from it. Every one of them is
    // `store.GetObj(name)` then `CToken::GetObj()`, and **`CToken::GetObj()` dereferences
    // `x0_objRef` with no null test** (`src/Kyoto/CToken.cpp:52`, which the port inherited
    // from retail). With no pak loaded there is no object behind the token, so on retail this
    // constructor would fault too - and it does. **Nothing here is a workaround for a
    // decompilation defect: the correct fix is upstream, and it is to give the pool something
    // real for the name.** `GetObj()` is deliberately left alone, and so is every null test.
    //
    // What the stand-in is, per class, and what is missing behind it:
    //
    //  * **`kSIK_Texture` - a real `CTexture`, constructed with `kTF_Invalid`, 0x0 and zero
    //    mip levels.** A `CTexture` with no bitmap behind it: the pixels are in the pak, and
    //    the object is the class, correctly constructed, with the format that says "there is
    //    nothing here". `CTexture(ETexelFormat, short, short, int)` has a host body
    //    (`src/Kyoto/Graphics/CTexturePortStub.cpp`, retail's own `0x802C6000` still
    //    unclaimed), so this is a constructed object and not a zeroed block pretending to be
    //    one - which matters, because the header's bitfields (`mCanLoadObj`, `mIsPowerOfTwo`,
    //    ...) would otherwise be lies. `GetBitMapData(0)` answers null, so a draw through one
    //    of these gets no texture and **renders nothing**. That is the honest answer and it is
    //    why this is a stand-in, not a frame.
    //  * **`kSIK_Model` - a real `CModel`, default-constructed.** `include/Kyoto/Graphics/
    //    CModel.hpp` is a measured, partial model (0x30 bytes: pads, `x1c_numParts` and
    //    `x28_touchTarget`) and has no constructor in the tree, so the implicit one is what
    //    runs. The model's vertex data, skeleton and part list are in `CMDL_*.pak`; there is
    //    none, so `x1c_numParts` is 0 and anything that iterates parts does nothing rather

/**
 * The stand-in object for one entry: the `IObj` wrapper the pool stores, plus the zeroed
 * `CStringTable` it points at, owned together so dropping the last reference frees both.
 *
 * **Why a wrapper at all.** `CToken::GetObj()` returns the `CObjectReference`'s `IObj*`, and
 * `TToken<T>::GetT()` then calls `GetContents()` on it (`include/Kyoto/IObj.hpp:25`,
 * `include/Kyoto/TToken.hpp:20`). What has to be in the reference is therefore a wrapper whose
 * `m_objPtr` is the `CStringTable`, and not the table itself - that is what makes
 * `TLockedToken<CStringTable>`'s `x8_item(*x0_token)` land on the right address.
 *
 * **Why it derives from `CObjOwnerDerivedFromIObjUntyped` and not from retail's
 * `TObjOwnerDerivedFromIObj<CStringTable>`.** Retail's derived template owns its contents -
 * `~TObjOwnerDerivedFromIObj` does `delete Owned()` - and that needs
 * **`CStringTable::~CStringTable()`**, which the port build does not have: the body lives in
 * `src/Kyoto/Text/CStringTable.cpp`, and that file is **excluded from `files.cmake`** because it
 * casts a pointer to `uint` at lines 92 and 98 and loses precision on a 64-bit host. Using
 * retail's wrapper does not link, which was measured rather than guessed - the first version of
 * this file used it and the probe reported the missing destructor by name.
 *
 * **And the `~COwnedStringTable` below is what stops that from being a leak.** The untyped
 * wrapper alone would free only itself and leave `sizeof(CStringTable)` bytes behind every time
 * a reference is dropped; retail's derived wrapper would have freed both, had it compiled. So the
 * derived class owns the block directly. `rstl::rmemory_allocator::deallocate` is the exact
 * counterpart of its `allocate` - `deallocate(T*)` is `delete[] reinterpret_cast<uchar*>(T*)`
 * and `allocate(int)` is `size == 0 ? nullptr : rs_new uchar[size]` (`include/rstl/
 * rmemory_allocator.hpp:102,145`, whose out-of-line body is `src/rstl/rstl_misc.cpp`) - so this
 * is a matched pair and not a `free` of somebody else's `malloc`.
