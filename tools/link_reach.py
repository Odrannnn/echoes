"""Which of the port's undefined symbols are reachable from the program roots?

The port's link asks for ~523 symbols. A stub for all of them would link, but a
stub is only *safe* for a symbol nothing on the boot path calls. So the question
is not "how many are undefined" but "how many are reachable from the roots", and
that is a graph question.

Roots, and the second is the easy one to miss:

  1. the entry object and everything in `mp_platform`;
  2. **every object that emits a static initialiser** (`_GLOBAL__sub_I*`), because
     those run before `main`. `src/MetroidPrime/ScriptLoader.cpp` is the one that
     matters: its `__sinit_ScriptLoader_cpp` is what drags the whole REL loader
     family in, so every `Load*` symbol is on the boot path whether or not any C++
     code calls it. Leave that root out and the analysis will call the 159 module
     loaders optional, which is the opposite of true.

Granularity is per **object**. `mp_game` is one CMake target holding 200 objects,
so a target-level walk marks all 200 reachable and answers nothing.

Stated weakness: the walk is branch-blind and whole-object, so it
over-approximates. That errs in the safe direction, which is why the first set
below is an upper bound on what a stub would endanger, not a claim that all of it
executes.

Self-checks, because a silently wrong number here would be believed:
  - every object the linker names must be readable by `nm`;
  - the linker's undefined set must be almost entirely contained in what `nm`
    reports as undefined (the linker resolves what nm can pair up), so
    `ld_undef - all_undef` must be near zero. If it is not, the symbol tables
    were not read correctly and the split below is meaningless.
